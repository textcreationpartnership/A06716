            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wher by it is often ſeen, that if any determin in thexerciſe of that kinde of ſeruice to preuaile, that incontinent he doeth not only chaunge in apparel, but alſo in cuſtome and maner, in voice, and from the facion of all ciuil vſe, he doeth alter: For that he thinketh not meete to clothe with ciuell apparell him, who wil be redie, and promt to all kinde of violence, nor the ciuell cuſtomes, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages maie that man haue, the whiche iudgeth bothe thoſe cuſtomes to be effeminate, and thoſe vſages not to be agreable to his profeſſion: Nor it ſemes not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for him to vſe the ciuill geſture and ordinarie wordes, who with faſing and blaſphemies, will make afraied other menne: the whiche cauſeth in this time, ſuche opinion to be moſte true.

<pb facs="tcp:12127:6"/> force of armes their defence wer not prepared, which well ordeined, doe maintain thoſe alſo whiche be not well ordeined. And likewiſe to the contrarie, the good orders, without the ſouldiours help, no leſſe or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doe diſorder, then the habitacion of a ſumptuous and roiall palais, although it wer decte with gold and precious ſtones, when without being couered, ſhould not haue wherewith to defende it from the raine. And if in what ſo euer other orders of Cities and Kyngdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, there hath been vſed al diligence for to maintain men faithfull, peaceable, and full of the feare of God, in the ſeruice of warre, it was doubled: for in what man ought the countrie to ſeke greater faith, then in him, who muſt promiſe to die for the ſame? In whom ought there to bee more loue of peace, then in him, whiche onely by the warre maie be hurte? In whome ought there to bee more feare of GOD, then in him, whiche euery daie commityng himſelf to infinite pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles, hath moſte neede of his helpe? This neceſſitie conſidered wel, bothe of them that gaue the lawes to Empires, &amp; of thoſe that to the exerciſe of ſeruice wee apoincted, made that the life of Souldiours, of other menne was praiſed, and with all ſtudie folowed and imitated. But the orders of ſeruice of war, beyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together corrupted, and a greate waie from the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maners altered, there hath growen theſe ſiniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions, which maketh men to hate the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſeruice, and to flie the conuerſacion of thoſe that dooe exerciſe it. Albeit I iudgeing by the ſame, that I haue ſeen and redde, that it is not a thyng impoſſible, to bryng it again to the auncient maners, and to giue it ſome facion of the vertue paſſed, I haue determined to the entente not to paſſe this my idell time, without doyng ſome thyng, to write that whiche I doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, of the arte of warre, to the ſatiſfiyng of thoſe, who are louers of auncient actes. And although it be a hold thing to intreate of the ſame matter, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of

Therefore Laurence you ought to conſider the qualitie of this my laboure, and with your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to giue it that blame, or that praiſe, as ſhall ſeeme vnto you it hath deſerued.

And I doe painly confeſſe, not to haue mette emongeſt ſo many men, as I haue knowen, &amp; practiſed withal, a man, whoſe minde was more infla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med then his, vnto great &amp; magnificent thynges. Nor he lamented not with his frendes of any thyng at his death, but becauſe he was borne to die a yong manne within his owne houſe, before he had gotten honour, and accordynge to his deſire, holpen any manne: for that he knewe, that of him coulde not be ſpoken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſauyng that there ſhould be dead a good freende. Yet it reſteth not for this, that we, and what ſo euer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:12127:8"/> that as we did know him, are not able to teſtifie (ſeeyng his woorkes doe not appere) of his lawdable qualities. True it is, that fortune was not for al this, ſo muche his enemie, that it left not ſome brief record of the readineſſe of his witte, as doeth declare certaine of his writinges, and ſettyng foorthe of amorous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherin (although he were not in loue) yet for that he would not conſume time in vain, til vnto profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtudies fortune ſhould haue brought him, in his youthfull age he exerciſed himſelfe. Whereby moſte plainly maie be comprehended, with how moche feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie he did deſcribe his conceiptes, and how moche for Poetrie he ſhould haue ben eſtemed, if the ſame for the ende therof, had of him ben exerciſed. Fortune hauing therfore depriued vs from the vſe of ſo great a frende, me thinketh there can bee founde no other remedie, then as muche as is poſſible, to ſeke to enioye the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the ſame, and to repeate ſuche thynges as hath been of him either wittely ſaied, or wiſely diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And for as much as there is nothyng of him more freſhe, then the reaſonyng, the whiche in his laſt daies Signior Fabricio Collonna, in his orchard had with him, where largely of the ſame gentilman were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted matters of warre, bothe wittely and prudently, for the moſte parte of Coſimo demaunded, I thought good, for that I was preſent there with certain other of our frendes, to bring it to memorie, ſo that reading theſame, the frendes of Coſimo, whiche thether came, might renewe in their mindes, the remembraunce of his vertue: and the other part beyng ſorie for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, might partly learne hereby many thynges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, not onely to the life of Souldiours, but alſo to ciuil mennes liues, which grauely of a moſte wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was diſputed. Therfore I ſaie, that Fabricio Collon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na retournyng out of Lombardie, where longe time greatly to his glorie, he had ſerued in the warres the catholike kyng, he determined, paſſyng by Florence,
<pb n="iiij" facs="tcp:12127:8"/> to reſt himſelf certain daies in the ſame citee, to viſite the Dukes excellencie, and to ſee certaine gentilmen, whiche in times paſte he had been acquainted withal. For whiche cauſe, vnto Coſimo it was thought beſte to bid him into his orchard, not ſo muche to vſe his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitee, as to haue occaſion to talke with him at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and of him to vnderſtande and to learne diuers thinges, accordyng as of ſuche a man maie bee hoped for, ſemyng to haue accaſion to ſpende a daie in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of ſuche matters, which to his minde ſhould beſt ſatiſfie him. Then Fabricio came, accordyng to his deſire, and was receiued of Coſimo together, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his truſtie frendes, emongeſt whome wer Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noby Buoudelmonti, Baptiſte Palla, and Luigi Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanni, all young men loued of him, and of the very ſame ſtudies moſte ardente, whoſe good qualities, for as muche as euery daie, and at euery houre thei dooe praiſe them ſelues, we will omit. Fabritio was then accordyng to the time and place honoured, of all thoſe honours, that thei could poſſible deuiſe: But the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettyng pleaſures beyng paſſed, &amp; the tabel taken vp, and al preparacion of feaſtinges conſumed, the which are ſone at an ende in ſight of greate men, who to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſtudies haue their mindes ſet, the daie beyng longe, and the heate muche, Coſimo iudged for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t better his deſire, that it wer well doen, takyng oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to auoide the heate, to bring him into the moſte ſecret, and ſhadoweſt place of his garden.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the firſte, I haue ſpoken as moche as hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into my mynde: there remaineth in me to ſpeake of the ſeconde, where I woll come to aunſwere to this your laſte queſtion, and I ſaie that Pompey and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, and almoſte all thoſe Capitaines, whiche were at Rome, after the laſte Carthagenens warre, gotte ſame as valiaunt men, not as good, and thoſe whiche liued before them, gotte glorie as valiaunte and good

And ſo longe as the common weale liued vnſpotted, neuer any noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezein would preſume, by the meane of ſoche exerciſe, to auaile thereby in peace, breakyng the lawes, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng the Prouinces, vſurpyng, and plaiyng the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte in the countrie, and in euery maner preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng: nor any of how lowe degree ſo euer thei were, would goe aboute to violate the Religion, confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng theim ſelues with priuate men, not to feare the Senate, or to followe any tirannicall inſolence, for to bee able to liue with the arte of warre in all tymes. But thoſe whiche were Capitaines, contented with triumphe, with deſire did tourne to their priuate life, and thoſe whiche were membrrs, would be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng to laie awaie their weapons, then to take them, and euery manne tourned to his ſcience, whereby thei gotte their liuyng: Nor there was neuer any, that would hope with praie, and with this arte, to be able to finde theim ſelues. Of this there maie be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng Citezeins, moſte euidente coniecture, by the enſample of Regolo Attillio, who beyng Capitain of the Romaine armies in Affrica, and hauyng as it wee ouercome the Carthegenens, he required of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, licence to retourne home, to kepe his poſſeſſions, and told them, that thei were marde of his houſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Whereby it is more clere then the Sunne, that if theſame manne had vſed the warre as his arte, and by meanes thereof, had purpoſed to haue made it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto him, hauyng in praie ſo many Prouinces, he would not haue aſked licenſe, to returne to kepe his feldes: for as moche as euery daie he might otherwiſe, haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moche more, then the value of al thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: but bicauſe theſe good men, and ſoche as vſe not the warre for their arte, will not take of theſame any thing then labour, perilles, and glorie, when thei

Concernyng menne of lowe degree, and common ſouldiours, to proue that thei kepte the verie fame order, it doeth appeare that euery one willingly abſented theim ſelues from ſoche exerciſe, and when thei ſerued not in the warre, thei would haue deſired to ſerue, and when thei did ſerue, their would haue deſired leaue not to haue ſerued: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is wel knowen through many inſamples, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſpecially ſeeyng how emonge the firſte priuileges, whiche the Romaine people gaue to their Citezeins was, that thei ſhould not be conſtrained againſt their willes, to ſerue in the warres.

To make warre alwaies, it is not poſſible: to paie them alwaies it can not be: ſee that of neceſſitie, he runneth in peril to leſe the ſtate.

<pb facs="tcp:12127:14"/> one the other, nor thei tarried not till there ſtrengthe ſhould decaie, and there naghtines increaſe, as it did after in the corrupted times. For as muche as Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian firſte, and after Tiberius, minding more there proper power, then the publicke profite, began to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme the Romaine people, to be able eaſely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them, &amp; to kepe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually thoſe ſame armies on the frontries of the Empire: and bicauſe alſo they iudged thoſe, not ſufficient to kepe brideled the people and Romaine Senate, they ordeined an armie called Protoriano, which laie harde by the walles of Rome, and was as a rocke on the backe of the ſame Citie. And for as much as then thei began frely to permitte, that ſuche men as were apoincted in ſuche exerciſes, ſhould vſe the ſeruice of warre for their arte, ſtreight waie the inſolence of theim grewe, that they became fearful vnto the Senate, and hurtefull to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whereby enſued ſuche harme, that manie were ſlaine thorough there inſolenſie: for that they gaue, and toke awaie the Empire, to whome they thought good.

And bicauſe you alledged me, I will make enſample vpon my ſelf, &amp; ſaie that I neuer vſed the warre as an arte, for as muche as my arte, is to gouerne my ſubiectes, and to defende them, &amp; to be able to defende them, to loue peace, &amp; to know how to

The ende of him that wil make warre, is to be able to fight with euery enemy in the fielde, &amp; to be able to ouercum an armie. To purpoſe to doe this, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ordeine an hooſt. To ordein an hooſt, their muſt be found menne, armed, ordered, and as well in the ſmall, as in the great orders exerciſed, to knowe howe to kepe araie, and to incampe, ſo that after brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them vnto the enemie, either ſtanding or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they maie know how to behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly. In this thing conſiſteth all the induſtrie of the
<pb facs="tcp:12127:16"/> warre on the lande, whiche is the moſt neceſſarie, and the moſt honorableſt, for he that can wel order a fielde againſt the enemie, the other faultes that he ſhould make in the affaires of warre, wilbe borne with: but he that lacketh this knowledge, although that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars he be verie good, he ſhal neuer bring a warre to honor: for as muche as a fielde that thou winneſt, doeth cancell all other thy euill actes: ſo like wiſe leſing it, all thinges well done of thee before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vaine. Therfore, beyng neceſſarie firſt to finde the menne, it is requiſet to come to the choiſe of them. They whiche vnto the warre haue giuen rule, will that the menne be choſen out of temperate countries, to the intente they may haue hardines, and prudence, for as muche as the hote countrey, bredes prudente men and not hardy, the colde, hardy, and not prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te. This rule is good to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to one that were prince of all the world, bicauſe it is lawfull for him to chooſe men out of thoſe places, whiche he ſhall thinke beſte.

But concernyng conſtrainte, you ought to vnderſtande, that the menne, whiche are conducted to warfare, by commaundement of their Prince, thei ought to come, neither altogether forced, nor altogether willyngly, for as moche as to moche willyngneſſe, would make thinconueniencies, where I told afore, that he ſhould not be a choſen manne, and thoſe would be fewe that would go: and ſo to moche conſtraint, will bring forth naughtie effectes.

I ſaie therfore, that the goodneſſe of one, whiche thou muſte chuſe for a Souldiour, is knowen either by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thorough meane of ſome of his worthy doynges, or by coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The proofe of vertue, cannot be founde in men whiche are choſen of newe, and whiche neuer afore haue ben choſen, and of theſe are founde either fewe or none, in the ordinaunce that of newe is ordeined. It is neceſſarie therefore, lackyng this experience, to runne to the coniecture, whiche is taken by the yeres, by the occupacion, and by the perſonage: of thoſe two firſt, hath been reaſoned, there remaineth to ſpeake of the thirde.

But my intencion is to ſhew you, how an armie maie be prepared in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, where there is no warlike diſcipline: in which countrie, choſen men cannot be had, to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtraight waie, but there, where the cuſtome is to leuie armies, and by meane of the Prince, thei maie then well bee had, as the Romaines obſerued, and as is obſerued at this daie emong the Suiſers: bicauſe in theſe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, though there be many newe menne, there be alſo ſo many of the other olde Souldiours, accuſtomed to ſerue in the warlike orders, where the newe mingled together with the olde, make a bodie vnited and good, notwithſtanding, that themperours after, beginning the ſtaciones of ordinarie Souldiours, had appoincted ouer the newe ſouldiours, whiche were called tironi, a maiſter to exerciſe theim, as appeareth in the life of Maſſimo the Emperour. The whiche thyng, while Rome was free, not onely in the armies, but in the

After theſe .iiij, thei choſe other fower, of which, firſt one was choſen of the Tribunes of the ſeconde Legion, the ſeconde of thoſe of the thirde, the thirde of thoſe of the fowerth, the fowerth remained to the firſt.

I wil giue you a little of a late enſample. There wer come out of Cicelie, into the kyngdome of Naples, a power
<pb facs="tcp:12127:29"/> of Spaniardes, for to go to finde Conſaluo, who was beſieged in Barlet, of the Frenchemen: there made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theim Mounſier de Vhigni, with his menne of armes, and with aboute fower thouſande Duchemen on foote: The Duchemen incountered with their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes lowe, and thei opened the power of the Spaniar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: but thoſe beyng holp, by meane of their bucklers and of the agiletie of their bodies, mingled togethers with the Duchemen, ſo that thei might reche the with the ſwearde, whereby happened the death, almoſte of all theim, and the victorie to the Spaniardes.

The greateſt diſorder,<note place="margin">The greateſte diſorder that is vſed now a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies in pitching of a fielde.</note> that thei make, whiche ordeine an armie to the fielde, is in giuing them onely one fronte, and to binde them to one brunt, and to one fortune: the whiche groweth, of hauyng loſte the waie, that the antiquitie vſed to receiue one bande within an other: bicauſe without this waie, thei can neither ſuccour the formoſte, nor defende them, nor ſuccede in the faight in their ſteede: the whiche of the Romaines, was moſte excellently well obſerued. Therefore,<note place="margin">The order how a Romain Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted to faight.</note> purpoſyng to ſhewe this waie, I ſaie, how that the Romaines deuided into .iij. partes euery Legion, in Haſtati, Prencipi, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arij, of which, the Haſtati wer placed in the firſt front, or forward of the armie, with thorders thicke &amp; ſure, behinde who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer the Prencipi, but placed with their orders more thinne: after theſe, thei ſet the Triarij, &amp; with ſo moche thinnes of orders, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei might, if nede wer, receiue betwene them the Prencipi, and the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati. Thei had beſides theſe, the Slingers, and Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowſhoters, and the other lighte armed, the whiche ſtoode not in theſe orders, but thei placed them in the hed of tharmie, betwene the horſes and the other ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of footemen: therefore theſe light armed, began the faight, if thei ouercame (whiche happened ſeldom times) thei folowed the victorie: if thei were repulced, thei retired by the flanckes of the armie, or by the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ordained for ſoche purpoſes, and thei brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues emong the vnarmed: after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> departure of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:12127:47"/> the Haſtati incountered with the enemie, the whiche if thei ſaw themſelues to be ouercome, thei retired by a little and little, by the rareneſſe of thorders betwene the Prencipi, and together with thoſe, thei renued the faight: if theſe alſo wer repulced, thei retired al in the rareneſſe of the orders of the Triarij, and al together on a heape, began againe the faight: and then, if thei were ouercome, there was no more remeady, bicauſe there remained no more waies to renue them again. The horſes ſtoode on the corners of the armie, to the likenes of twoo winges to a bodie, &amp; ſomewhiles thei fought with the enemies horſes, an other while, thei reſcued the fotmen, according as nede required. This waie of renuyng theim ſelues three tymes, is almoſte impoſſible to ouercome: for that, fortume muſte three tymes forſake thee, and the enemie to haue ſo moche ſtrengthe, that three tymes he maie ouercome thee. The Grekes, had not in their Falangi, this maner of renuyng them ſelues, and although in thoſe wer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heddes, and many orders, notwithſtandyng, thei made one bodie,<note place="margin">The maner that the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vſed in their Falangi, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei fought againſt their enemies.</note> or els one hedde: the maner that thei kepte in reſcuyng the one the other was, not to retire the one order within the other, as the Romaines, but to enter the one manne into the place of the other: the which thei did in this maner. Their Fala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge brought into rankes, and admit, that thei put in a ranke fiftie menne, commyng after with their hedde againſte the enemie, of all the rankes the foremoſte ſixe, mighte faight: Bicauſe their Launces, the whiche thei called Sariſſe, were ſo long, that the ſixt ranke, paſſed with the hedde of their Launces, out of the firſt ranke: then in faightyng, if any of the firſt, either through death, or through woundes fell, ſtraight waie there entered into his place, theſame man, that was behinde in the ſecond ranke, and in the place that remained voide of the ſeconde, theſame man entred, whiche was behind hym in the thirde, and thus ſucceſſiuely, in a ſodaine
<pb n="xliij" facs="tcp:12127:47"/> the rankes behinde, reſtored the faultes of thoſe afore, ſo that the rankes alwaies remained whole, and no place of the faighters was voide, except the laſte ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, the whiche came to conſume, hauyng not menne behinde their backes, whom might reſtore theim: So that the hurte that the firſt rankes ſuffered, conſumed the laſte, and the firſte remained alwaies whole: and thus theſe Falangi by their order, might ſoner be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, then broken, for that the groſſe bodie, made it more immouable.

<pb facs="tcp:12127:48"/> whiche were in a Romaine Legion, might be placed in ſoche wiſe, that thei might receiue betwene theim, and reſcue the one the other. And to proue this order of the Suizzers not to be ſo good, as the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, many inſamples of the Romain Legions doe declare, when thei fought with the Grekes Falangi, where alwaies thei were conſumed of theim: for that the kinde of their weapons (as I haue ſaid afore) and this waie of renuyng themſelues, could do more, then the maſſiueneſſe of the Falangi. Hauyng therefore, with theſe inſamples to ordaine an armie, I haue thought good, partly to retaine the maner of armyng and the orders of the Grekes Falangi, and partely of the Romain Legions:<note place="margin">Howe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincte a main battaile with armour &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Greke &amp; Romain maner</note> and therfore I haue ſaied, that I would haue in a main battaile, twoo thouſande pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, whiche be the weapons of the Macedonicall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langi, and three thouſande Targaettes with ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whiche be the Romain weapons: I haue deuided the main battaile, into .x. battailes, as the Romaines their Legion into ten Cohortes: I haue ordeined the Veliti, that is the light armed to begin the faight, as the Romaines vſed: and like as the weapons beyng mingled, doe participate of thone and of the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, ſo the orders alſo doe participate: I haue ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that euery battaile ſhall haue v. rankes of Pikes in the fronte, and the reſt of Targaettes, to bee able with the front, to withſtande the horſes, and to enter eaſely into the battaile of the enemies on foot, hauing in the firſte fronte, or vawarde, Pikes, as well as the enemie, the whiche ſhall ſuffice me to withſtande the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Targaettes after to ouercome theim.

This, a bande of menne ordered, cannot dooe: bicauſe if the ſame marche haſtely, it goweth out of order: if it go ſcattered, the enemie ſhall haue no paine to breake it, for that it breaketh by it ſelf: and therfore, I ordered the armie after ſoche ſorte, that it might dooe the one thyng and the other: for as moche as hauyng ſet in the corners thereof, a thouſande Veliti, I appoincted that after that our ordinaunce had ſhotte, thei ſhould iſſue out together with the light horſemen, to get the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies artillerie: and therfore, I made not my ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſhoote again, to the intente, to giue no tyme to the enemie to ſhoote: Bicauſe ſpace could not be giuen to me, and taken from other men, and for theſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where I made my ordinaunce not to ſhoote the ſeconde tyme, was for that I would not haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the enemie to haue ſhot at al,<note place="margin">The beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to auoide the hurte that the enemie in the fielde maie doe with his ordinaunce.</note> if I had could: ſeyng that to mynde that the enemies artillerie be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, there is no other remedie, but to aſſaulte it ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely: for as moche as if the enemies forſake it, thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſte it, if thei will defende it, it is requiſite that thei leaue it behind, ſo that being poſſeſſed of enemies, and of frendes, it cannot ſhoote.

<pb facs="tcp:12127:76"/> that me thinketh, hauyng ſo moche traiuailed theim, it is tyme to refreſhe them, and to comfort them with meate. You haue to vnderſtande, that a Prince ought to ordaine his armie, as expedite as is poſſible, &amp; take from theſame all thoſe thynges, whiche maie cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble or burthen vnto it, and make vnto hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enterpriſe difficulte. Emongeſt thoſe thynges that cauſeth moſte difficultie, is to be conſtrained to keepe the armie prouided of wine, and baked bread. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie cared not for Wine, for that lackyng it, thei dranke water, mingeled with a little vinegre, to giue it a taſte: For whiche cauſe, emong the municions of victualles for the hoſte, vineger was one, &amp; not wine. Thei baked not the breade in Ouens, as thei vſe for Citees, but thei prouided the Meale, and of theſame, euery Souldiour after his owne maner, ſatiſfied hym ſelf, hauyng for condimente Larde and Baken, the whiche made the breade ſauerie, that thei made, and maintained theim ſtrong,<note place="margin">The victualles that thantiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie made proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, for their armies.</note> ſo that the prouiſion of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualles for the armie, was Meale, Vineger, Larde, and Bacon, and for the horſes Barley. Thei had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarely heardes of greate beaſtes and ſmall, whiche folowed the armie, the whiche hauyng no nede to bee carried, cauſed not moche impedimente. Of this order there grewe, that an armie in old time, marched ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes many daies through ſolitarie places, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte, without ſufferyng diſeaſe of victualles: for that thei liued of thyngs, whiche eaſely thei might conuey after them. To the contrarie it happeneth in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that are now a daies, whiche mindyng not to lacke wine, and to eate baked breade in theſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as when thei are at home, whereof beyng not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make prouiſion long, thei remaine often tymes famiſhed, or though thei be prouided, it is dooen with diſeaſe, and with moſte greate coſte: therfore I would reduce my armie to this maner of liuing: and I would not that thei ſhould eate other bread, then that, which

Concernyng wine, I would not prohihite the drinkyng thereof, nor yet the commyng of it into the armie, but I would not vſe indeuour, nor any labour for to haue it, &amp; in the other prouiſions, I would gouerne my ſelf altogether, like vnto the antiquitie: the whiche thing, if you conſider well, you ſhall ſee how moche difficultie is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, and how moche trouble and diſeaſe, an armie and a capitaine is auoided of, and how moche commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie ſhall bee giuen, to what ſo euer enterpriſe is to bee dooen.</p>

                     <p>You dooe me, as all readie I haue ſaied, a moſte greate pleaſure: for this your interrupting me, taketh not awaie my fantaſie, but rather refreſheth me. But mindyng to followe our matter I ſaie, how that it is now tyme, that we lodge this our armie, for
<pb facs="tcp:12127:82"/> that you knowe euery thyng deſireth reſte and ſaftie, bicauſe to reſte, and not to reſte ſafely, is no perfecte reſte: I doubte moche, whether it hath not been deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of you, that I ſhould firſte haue lodged them, after made theim to marche, and laſte of all to faight, and we haue doen the contrary: whereunto neceſſitie hath brought vs, for that intendyng to ſhewe, how an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in going, is reduced from the forme of marching, to theſame maner of faightyng, it was neceſſarie to haue firſte ſhewed, how thei ordered it to faight. But tournyng to our matter, I ſaie, that minding to haue the Campe ſure, it is requiſite that it be ſtrong, and in good order: the induſtrie of the Capitaine, maketh it in order, the ſituacion, or the arte, maketh it ſtronge. The Grekes ſought ſtrong ſituacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">How the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes incamped.</note> nor thei would neuer place theim ſelues, where had not been either caue, or bancke of a riuer, or multitude of trees, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall fortificacion, that might defende theim: but the Romaines not ſo moche inca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ped ſafe through the ſituacion,<note place="margin">Howe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> as through arte, nor thei would neuer incampe in place, where thei ſhould not haue been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue raunged all their bandes of menne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to their diſcipline. Hereby grewe, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines might kepe alwaies one forme of incamping, for that thei would, that the ſituacion ſhould bee ruled by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not thei by the ſituacion: the which the Grekes could not obſerue, for that beyng ruled by the ſituaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and variyng the ſituacion and forme, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniente, that alſo thei ſhould varie the maner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campyng, and the facion of their lodgynges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romaines, where the ſituacion lacked ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth thei ſupplied theſame with arte, and with induſtrie. And for that I in this my declaracion, haue willed to imitate the Romaines, I will not departe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their incamping, yet not obſeruyng altogether their order, but takyng theſame parte, whiche ſemeth vnto me, to be mete for this preſent tyme. I haue told
<pb n="lxxviij" facs="tcp:12127:82"/> you many tymes, how the Romaines had in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

You knowe, that in ſtede of twoo Romaine Legions, I haue taken twoo maine battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of footemen, of ſixe thouſande footemen, and three hundred horſemen, profitable for a maine battaile, and into what battailes, into what weapons, into what names I haue deuided theim: you knowe howe in orderyng tharmie to marche, and to faight, I haue not made mencion of other men, but onely haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, how that doublyng the men, thei neded not but to double the orders: but mindyng at this preſente, to ſhew you the maner of incampyng, me thinketh good not to ſtande onely with twoo maine battailes, but to bryng together a iuſte armie, made like vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, of twoo maine battailes, and of as many mo aidyng men: the whiche I make, to the intent that the forme of the incampyng, maie be the more perfect, by lodgyng a perfecte armie: whiche thyng in the other demonſtracions, hath not ſemed vnto me ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

<pb facs="tcp:12127:83"/> beeyng deuided into fower maine battailes, twoo of our owne menne, and twoo of ſtraungers, I would take this waie. The ſituacion beyng founde, where I would incampe, I would erecte the hed ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darde, and aboute it, I would marke out a quadrant, whiche ſhould haue euery ſide diſtante from it .xxxvij. yardes and a half, of whiche euery one of them ſhould lye, towardes one of the fower regions of heauen, as Eaſte, Weſte, Southe, and Northe: betwene the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſpace,<note place="margin">The lodging for the generall capitaine.</note> I would that the capitaines lodgyng ſhould be appoincted.

I would lodge all, or the greateſt parte of the armed, on the ſide towardes the Eaſte, and the vnarmed, and the cumbred, on the Weſte ſide, makyng Eaſte the hedde, and Weſte the backe of the Campe, and Southe, and Northe, ſhould be the flanckes: and for to diſtinguiſhe the lodgynges of the armed, I would take this waie. I would drawe a line from the hedde ſtandarde, and lead it towardes the Eaſte, the ſpace of .CCCCC.x. yardes and a half: I would after, make two other lines, that ſhould place in the middeſte the ſame, and ſhould bee as longe as that, but ſtiſtante eche of theim from it a leuen yardes and a quarter: in the ende whereof, I would haue the Eaſte gate, and the ſpace that is betwene the twoo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſte lines, ſhould make a waie, that ſhould go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gate, to the capitaines lodging, whiche ſhall come to be .xxij. yardes and a halfe broad, and .CCCClxxij. yardes and a halfe longe, for the .xxxvij. yardes and a halfe, the lodgyng of the Capitaine will take vp: and this ſhall bee called the Capitaine waie.

In the other .xv. lodgynges, that on euerie ſide followeth after theſe, euen vnto the ouerthwarte way, I would lodge on euerie part a battaile of foote men, whiche beyng .iiij. hundred &amp; fiftie, there will come to a lodgyng .xxx. the other .xv. lodgynges,<note place="margin">The nomber of footemen appoicted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery lodging.</note> I woulde place continually on euery ſide on thoſe of the light horſe men, with the verie ſame ſpaces, where I woulde lodge on euerie part, an other battaile of fote men, and in the laſte lodgyng, I would place on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte the Coneſtable of the battaile, whiche will

The reaſon is this: the carte when it is laden, either goeth euen, or leanyng vpon the right, or vpon the lefte ſyde: when it goeth euen, the wheeles equally ſuſteine the waight, the whiche beyng equally deuided between them, doeth not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den much, but leanyng, it cometh to haue al the paiſe of the cariage on the backe of that wheele vppon the which it leaneth.

By what God or by what ſainctes may I make them to ſweare? By thoſe that thei worſhip, or by thoſe that they blaſpheme? Who they worſhip I knowe not anie: but I knowe well they blaſpheme all. How ſhoulde I beleeue that thei will keepe their promiſe to them, whome euerie hower they diſpiſe? How can they, that diſpiſe God, reuerence men?

And if you ſhould aledge vnto me that Suyzzers and Spaniardes bee good ſouldiours, I woulde confeſſe vnto you, how they be farre better then the Italians: but if you note my reaſonynge, and the maner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng of bothe, you ſhall ſee, howe they lacke many thynges to ioygne to the perfection of the antiquetie.

And alwaies there ſhall be as manie rankes in al after .21. to a ranke, as are three times ſo many as the roote is of, which is, three times 63. which comes to .189. ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .189. rankes of men ſhall be the number therof after .21. to a ranke. And by the roote that is .63. you may vnderſtande that ſuche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion is to be made betwene .63. and .63. ſo that the firſte parte ſhalbe as well .63. as alſo the ſeconde and the thirde.

I meane cauſynge thoſe of the ſaied ſeconde parte, to march .26. men in a ranke, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fyrſt &amp; the laſt part of the great rewe of rankes, be .25. men in a ranke, &amp; the ſeconde parte to bee .26. men in a ranke, and the verie ſame ought to be doen of euery other roote that may be deuided into three, where onely remaineth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus one, but when there remayneth ouerplus .2. it foloweth cleane contrarie: For that the firſte and the laſte parte, would be of one man more, then the ſame that the thirde parte of the roote is of. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample if the ſaied men were .2809, the roote whereof is .53. which deuided into there, comes to .71. and .2. remainyng ouerplus: therfore of ſo many men, ther ſhall be made .159. rankes (that is three times .53.) whiche .159. rankes deuidynge them alſo into three partes, cometh vnto .53. to a parte, that is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the roote. And the firſte and thirde part would be of one man more then the thirde parte of the roote, that is, it woulde be of .18. men to a ranke, and the ſeconde parte, whiche is the parte in the middeſt, would be the very thyrde parte of the roote: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, 17. men to a ranke, ſo that of all the .159. rankes, as wel the fyrſt .53. rankes, as likewiſe the laſte .53. rankes, ought to be of .18. men to a ranke, &amp; the .53. rankes in the middeſt woulde be onely of .17. men to a ranke. And, wherin partyng the roote into .3. there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouerplus only one, it goeth cleane contrarie to this. For that the fyrſte and the thirde parte of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12127:129"/> ſaied great rew of rankes, wil alwaies be of as many men to a ranke as ſhalbe the whole third parte of the roote, and the middell parte, which is the ſecond, will be of one man more then the thirde part of the roote. And for as much, as there can neuer remaine ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus aboue one or twoo in deuidyng the roote into .3. therfore this foreſaied rule ſhall ſerue in what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men ſo euer it bee, as well Quadrante as not Quadrant, for that lyke as before is ſaied in numbers not Quadrante, alwaies ther is taken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote which goeth nereſt to ſuch a number, and therwith to doo accordyngly, as aboue hath ben ſaied. And as for the reſidue of the men that cometh to be ouerplus of the Quadrante of ſuch a roote, may be placed ſome other where as ſhall be thought moſte beſt. For example if there were .4000. men, whiche number is not Quadrante, yet notwithſtandynge of the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there ought to bee taken oute the neereſt roote therof, whiche is .63. ſo that there ſhall remayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus .31. men, whome mindynge in a ſudden to brynge into a fowerſquare battell, there ought to be put in a ranke .63. men, and ſuch a battell ſhal come to be fowerſquare, as in the beginning hath ben ſaid: and where there remaines ouerplus thoſe .31. men, the Sergiant may place them as he ſhal thinke good. Likewiſe myndynge to cauſe thoſe .4000. men to marche, there ought alſo to be taken the nereſt roote therof, which as aforeſaied, is .63. whiche deuidyng into three, comes vnto three times .21. and nothing remaynyng ouerplus. And therfore the ſaied menne ought to be cauſed to marche .21. in a ranke, and the ſayed ranke to be deuided into three partes .63. to a ranke accordynge to the foreſaied rule, in ſuche ſorte that the laſt parte ſhall be .64. rankes, and alſo .10. men more, becauſe of thoſe .31. men that were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus in the beginnyng, the whiche as hath been ſaied remained out of the aray: And after the ſame maner,

And it is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that the chief thyng that is in pouder, is Salt peter: for that of it (by theſame that is ſeen) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth all the forſe. And therefore prouiſion is to be made, to haue a good quantitie thereof, and that it be cleane and nete: the whiche by burnyng, maie well be knowen, for that in all ſortes of pouder, it is nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the Saltpeter be good.</p>
                  <p>Now, for to make common pouder, for great peces of artillerie, there muſt be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thre partes, of refined Saltpeter, two of Willowe coales, and one of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and grinding euery thing: all muſt be wel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together, &amp; all the moiſtneſſe thereof dried vp, as I haue ſaied. To make pouder for ſmall peces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, there muſte bee taken fiue partes, of refined Saltpeter, and one and a halfe of Coales, and one of Brimſtone, and grindyng it moſte finelie, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng it well together, it muſte bee corned, and then dried. The maner of cornyng all ſortes of pouder, is with a Seeue made, with a thicke ſkinne of Parche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full of little rounde holes, into the whiche ſeue the pouder muſt bee put, while it is danke, and alſo a little bowle, that when you ſifte, maie rolle vp and doune, vpon the clottes of pouder, to breake theim, that it maie corne, and runne through the holes of the Seeue.</p>
                  <p>To make Harkebuſe and hande Gunne pouder, there muſt be taken tenne partes of refined Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one of young baſell coles of a year olde made clean, and one parte of brimſtone, and beatinge all in a mortar or grindinge it excedingly well that it maye be mingled together and ſo fine as is poſſible, then it muſte be corned and thoroughlie dried. And note that if it be not marveluſly well beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it wil neuer be good. But bycauſe makinge of poulder, whiche ar of thinges that will eaſelie kindell, cannot be withoute
<pb facs="tcp:12127:152"/> perril of him that maketh it, excepte it be remedied with weating: therefor it behoueth to take hede that it be not beaten drie, as well to auoide ſuche perrill, as alſo for that it wilbe beaten better: for whiche cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes it muſte be wet with comun water to a certaine degree of moiſtenes, ſo that taken vp in ones hande it maye clingh together. Sum moiſt it with vineger: and ſum, for to make it more ſtronger, with ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phored <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> When I haue cauſed gunpoulder to bee made, I haue vſed comun water, and therefore I am able to ſaye whiche of thoſe thinges is beſt: and to tell my opinion, I doubte whether vineger or <hi>aqua vitae</hi> cauſeth the gunpoulder to be anie better then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water: for as muche as they vaporinge awaye, as they doe, and as of neceſſetie they muſte, I beleue that littel of their ſubſtaunce remaineth. There be ſum whiche in makinge cole (beſides wellowe) make them of haſell: and ſum of vyne ſtickes: and ſum of baie ſtickes: ſum of reedes: ſum of kecſes: and to bee ſhorte, all the coles that ar made of ſofte wood, ar of wood whiche haue muche pith: but it is requiſet that they be ſmalle, yong, and tender, and withoute harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of knottes: otherwyſe they be not good: Albeyt they be made in diuerſe maners: but in makinge of enie greate quantetie of poulder, the ordinarie cole is to be taken:<note place="margin">How to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke cole wher with gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der is made.</note> and makinge a littell, they vſe to take yonge haſell of a year olde, cut in ſhorte peſes, &amp; then puttinge them into a great yerthen potte, or other vecell of yron, or braſſe, they ſhutte it &amp; keuer it cloſe, and lute it or daube it verie wel aboute, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not breathe: and then they make fire rounde aboute it and vpon it, till ſuche time as it maye be thoughte that the heate is well entred in through all, &amp; that the wood that is within is very well fired: &amp; without fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandes, or flame, burned only through ſuche heate: and then they take the fire from the potte and let it coole,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12127:152"/> and ſo they finde the ſame wood becum cole. I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onſe to haue nede of coles (to thintente to make ſum quicklie, toke as manie drie haſel ſtickes that had theire ryndes ſcraped of, as I thought ſufficiente to ſerue my purpoſe: and breaking them in peſes and lai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge them cloſe together on a hepe, I ſet them on fire and burned them all well, and then ſprinckeled water vpon them with a broume, and with the ſame wet brume quenched the fier: &amp; ſo ſcattered abrod the coles heare and there, allwayes ſprinckelinge water vpon them till I quenched them: and thus I haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued my purpoſe withoute ſo muche difficultie.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is a verie proffitable thinge, yea and a neceſſary, that I declare the maner &amp; faciletie of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, for to be able ſafelie to make a greate quante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therof. In olde time they wer wonte to grinde gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poulder with certayne handemilles, as they vſe to grinde corne, but (beſides the paine) it is awaye verie perrillus: for that ſuche a compoſition grownde toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther with ſtones, will catche heate in ſuche wyſe, that it wil ſone inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der fire, ineſpetialy euery thing being a matter diſpoſed to fire: as alſo by rubbinge together with viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a cople of baye ſtickes, yow ſhal ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te waye kendell fire. Sum grinde poulder in ſuche mylles as they vſe to grind crabbes or apells to make vargis or cider: and ſum hathe it ſtamped in morters with a water mille or a horſemill, which waye is the beſte of all other, and moſte ſureſte and alſo it is bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten finelier, and with leſſe labor and paine. Sum (that hathe not the comodetie of water) make a greate wheele, deuiſed after ſuche ſorte, that with the cogges therof it maye raiſe vp many heuy peſtells, whiche fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linge, beate in diuers morters of wood made in a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of oke, of the whiche there be ſum haue the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of braſſe.</p>
                  <p>Sum ſtampe with theire armes, with a great peſtel
<pb facs="tcp:12127:153"/> tied to the ende of a pole with a corde, righte ouer, a morter of wood or braſſe, and ſo they beate the eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier: other ſome beate it in a ſtone morter, with the mouthe ſumwhat large, with a wooden peſtell, with the handel therof made like vnto a hamner or a mall. And theſe, and other, that maye be made, is as moche as aboute the deuiſe of beating and making gunpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is nedefull.</p>
                  <p>They haue vſed heretofore to waighe euery mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it ſelfe, and then they haue gone mingling and beating all together. There haue been after, ſum that haue deuiſed to beate euery thing ſeuerally by it ſelf, and then mingelld alltogether and made it. But fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the beſte and moſte readieſte waye, is to take a a quantetie of ſaltepeter, wherewith you will make your poulder, &amp; put it into a cauldron with ſo muche water (as being ſet vpon the fire) maye bee thought ſufficiente to diſolue it: whiche ſo ſone as it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, muſte be taken of and ſet on the grounde in a cold place: and the quantitee of beaten coles that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, muſte be put into it, and ſo ſlurringe it aboute, muſte be mingled well with the ſaltepeter deſolued: and then taking your brimſtone finely beaten in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with a ſtaffe ſtirring about the coles and the ſaltepeter, you muſte ſtrawe it finely vpon the ſame, as well as you can, with continuall ſturringe and minglinge them together, whiche compoſition thus made, you muſte then drie ſumwhat in the ſunne: and then to haue it excellently well made, there nedeth no other to be doen, but to beate it all together, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente that it maye incorporate moſte finely, whiche doen, you muſt drie it with moſte greate dilligence: and then ſift it very wel through a ſeue, and moiſting it again with water or vineger, ſturring it ſumwhat together in a ſeue, you maye corne it as alreadie hath ben declared: and then againe for to occupie it aboute
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12127:153"/> your buſines you muſte drie it well: and ſo beeyng dried, put it into drie vecells of wood to kepe: and ſet it in the higheſte places of your houſe, where fewe cometh for diuers reſpectes: and though it wer for no other, at leaſt to kepe it drie. They that are experte, knowe good poulder in this maner, by the color: for that if it be verie blacke, it is a ſigne that it is made with verie muche coles: or that it is moiſte: and when you rubbe it vpon a pece of paper it will black it more then it ought to doe: and drawing it with your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, you maie ſe whether it be finelie beaten or no: for it muſte be ſo muche beaten that nothing, neither of ſaltepeter nor of Brimſtone be diſerned in any wiſe: for with reaſon they ought not to bee ſeen: they take alſo for a triall, three or fower cornes of poulder, and laye theim vpon a white Paper, diſtaunte three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the one from the other, and fire one of theim: and if the poulder bee good, you ſhall ſee theim all to fire at tones: ſo that there ſhal be no reſidence remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, neither groſenes of Brimſtone, nor of ſaltepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor of any other thing, and the paper not burnte. And if it be not ſo fownde, thei knowe that it is euell made, or not good, but full of yearthenes of Saltepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: or that it is moiſte, ſo that it is naughte for ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ordinaunce, beſides the perrill that it putteth them in. And vndoubtedly naughtie poulder, is a coſt halfe caſte awaye: and it is a greate faute in him that maketh it, or that cauſeth it to bee made: for that in time of nede, it is of no effecte, &amp; cauſeth muche ſhame to the Gunners, whiche occupie it: and therefore dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought to be vſed and, good hede taken that it be made accordyng as I haue taughte. There are many whiche bryng vp lies, ſaiyng: that they can tell howe to make poulder that ſhoting it in gunnes ſhall make no noiſe, the which is impoſſible, the fire and the aire violentlie incountering together, where beſides that
<pb facs="tcp:12127:154"/> they ar not able to doe the ſame they ſaye, with a pece of ordinaunce, they ar leſſe able to doe it with one of thoſe potgunnes of elder that boyes vſe to ſhute pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſlowes in, by the noiſe of whiche, maye well be perceiued, that all procedeth of breakinge of the ayre. Alſo there be manie that ſaye, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make white poulder, that ſhall not blacke ons handes, by putting in a certaine thing in the ſtede of coles: ſum other, redde, with dried red flowres: and other blewe, with blewe flowers: ſum other ſaye that to make the poulder of more force and ſtrengthe, that it is verie good to put to euery pounde of brimſtone an ounce of mercurie, the brimſtone being firſt put in by a littel, &amp; a littel. Morouer there ar ſum other that ſaye, that for to make the like, there ought to be put to euery pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſaltepeter, a quarter of an ounce of ſalte armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac: ſum other therebe alſo, whiche ſaye that in the ſtede of coles, it is better to take linen clothe and to burne it to tinder, and therewith to make poulder, whiche is more excellenter then eny other cole that is poſſible to be vſed, aboute ſuche a purpoſe. And all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in my iudgemente I haue declared all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy the beſt receites, that is for the makyng of all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of gunpoulder, yet to the intente that it maye bee vnderſtonde howe muche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue trauailed and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gened to bring the ſame to all perfection, I haue thought good to ſhow herefollowing diuers moe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes bothe good and bad, whiche for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of poulder hathe ben experienſed of ſundrie men.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12127:158"/> begin to ſpeake concerning their firſte opinion, that the aunchie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Romaine armies ſhulde not haue made the conqueſtes which they did, if the ordinaunce had ben in thoſe dayes. To which anſwering I ſay, how that warre is made eyther to defende, or to offende. Where firſt it is to be examened, to whom theſe two maner of warres cauſeth moſte proffit, or moſt hurte. And albeit ther is what to ſay of either part, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding I beleue, that withoute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, they doe more harme to him that defendeth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth. The reaſon is, that he that defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, is either in a toun, or in a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe within a tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che. If he be within a toune, this toune is eyther littel, as the moſte parte of fortreſſes ar, or it is greate. In the firſt caſe, he that defendeth, is altogether loſte: for that the violence of the artillerie is ſuche, that ther is no wall, how great ſo euer it be, which in feu dayes it battereth not dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if he that is within, haue not ſpace inough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, bothe with diches, and with rampiers, he is ouer cum, becauſe he is not abell to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the violence of the enemie, who through the breache of the wall, will after enter: nor in this caſe, the artillerie which he ſhulde haue, ſhall not helpe him: for that this is a generall rule, that where men in a throng, &amp; with vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may goe, the artillerie cannot withold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the defence of a toune, the furie of the enemies cannot be withſtonde. Though the aſſaltes the which are not thronged, but ſcattered, which be called ſcir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſhes be eaſely withſtode. And they which goe with this diſorder, and coldenes to a breache of a wall, where artillerie is, doe goe to a manifeſte deathe, and againſte them the artillerie preuaileth: but thoſe, which aſſaulte a breache in a throng harde together, ſo that the one thruſteth forwarde the other if they be not holden oute of dyches, or of rampiers, they enter in euery place, and the artillerie kepeth
<pb facs="tcp:12127:159"/> them not backe, and though ſum be ſlaine, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſo manie, that they ſhall let the victorie. This is knowen to be trew, by many expugnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of tounes made in Italie, and in eſpetiallie in the ſame of Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia: for as muche as the ſame toune being rebelled from the frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet the fortreſſe being kepte for the King of Fraunce, the Venetians for to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the violence, which from the ſame might cum into the toune, had laid all the ſtrete full of Artillerie, which deſcended from the fortreſſe to the Citie, &amp; they planted them on the fronte, and in the flankes, and in euery other fitt place. Of the which Mounſier de Fois made no other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte, but with his ſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, coming downe on foote paſſing through the middeſt of them, got the citie: nor it was not knowen that he receiued by thoſe enie notabel hurte. So that he that defendeth him ſelfe within a littel toune (as hathe ben ſayde) and findeth the wall on the grounde, and hathe not ſpace to retire with rampiers, and with diches, and is conſtrayned to truſte vpon the artillerie, is ouercum ſtraight way. If thou defendeſt a great toune, &amp; wher thou haſte comodity to retire, yet not withſtanding withoute compariſon, the artillerie is more proffitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell to him which is withoute, then to him that is within. Firſte, to mynde to haue a pece of Artillerie hurte thoſe withoute, thou arte conſtrained to get the vp with it from the plaine grounde of the toune: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtanding vpon the plaine grounde, euery littell banke and rampier that the enemie may make, ſhall cauſe him to remaine ſafe, and thou canſt not hurte him, ſo that being driuen to ſtande alofte on the toppe of the wall, or in what ſo euer other maner on highe, thou draweſt after the twoo difficulties. The firſte is, that thou canſte not bring vp ſo greate and mightie peſes of artillerie, as he withoute may ſhoote, being not able in littel ſpaces to handell great thinges. The
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12127:159"/> other is, that although thou couldeſt bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt not make ſuche ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; ſure defence for to ſaue the ſaid artillerie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſmounting, as they without may doe, being on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; hauing that comoditie and that rome, that they them ſelues liſte. So that it is im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſſible for him that defendeth a toune, to kepe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie on high places, when they which are without haue great ordinaunce inough. And if they be driuen to come with them on low places, they becum for the moſte parte vnprofittable, as hath ben ſayde. So that the defence of the citie, is brought to be defended with armes, as in old time they did, and with ſmall artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Of which if there be gotten a littel proffitte (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſpecte to the ſame ſmall artillerie) there is got<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten ſo much incomoditie, as counterpeaſeth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the artillerie: for as muche as hauing reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte to the ſame, they make the wals of tounes low, and as it wer vnder grounde in diches, ſo that ſo ſone as they cum to the battaile at hande, eyther becauſe the walles ar battered, or becauſe the dyches ar filled vp, he that is within, hath muche more diſſadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, then he ſhoulde haue had in times paſſe. And therfore (as afore is ſayde) thoſe inſtrumentes helpeth muche more him that beſigeth a toune, then he that is beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Concerning the thirde thing, to lye in campe within a trenche, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te not to faighte the fielde but at thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, or aduauntage, I ſay, that in this parte thou haſt no more remedy ordinarelie to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fende thee from faighting, then they had in olde time. And ſumtimes, conſidering the artillerie, thou haſte greater diſaduauntage: for that if the enemie meete with thee, and haue a littell aduauntage of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as may eaſely chaunce, and finde him ſelfe higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou, or that in his coming thou haſt not yet made thie bankes or rampiers, and keuered thee well with thoſe, ſtrayghte waye, and before thou haſte enie reme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:12127:160"/> he vnlodgeth thee, and thou arte conſtrained to iſſue oute of thy fortreſſe, &amp; come to faighte: the which happened to the Spaniardes in the battaile of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, who being fortefied betwene the ryuer of Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and a banke, becauſe they lay not ſo highe as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and for that the Frenchmen had a littell the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage of the grounde, they wer conſtrained of the artillerie to iſſue oute of their fortreſſe, and cum to faight. But admit that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, which thou haſt taken with the campe, wer muche higher, then the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte it (as for the moſte parte it ought to be) &amp; that the bankes or rampiers wer good and ſure, ſo that by meanſe of the ſituation, and thy other preparations, the enemy durſte not aſſaulte thee, it ſhall cum in this caſe to thoſe maners, which in olde time it cam, when one was with his army in place not poſſible to be hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te: the which ar to ouerun the countrie, to take, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſege the tounes that ar thy friendes, to ſtoppe thee thy vitualls, ſo that thou ſhalte bee conſtrayned of ſum neceſſetie to vnlodge, and cum to fayghte the fielde, where the artillerie (as herafter ſhalbe ſayde) doeth not muche hurte. Conſidering then what kynde of warres the Romaines made, &amp; ſeing how they made almoſte all their warre to inuade other men, and not for to defended them ſelues, it ſhalbe ſeen (when the thinges ſayde afore be trew) how they ſhuld haue had more aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, and muche ſouner ſhuld haue made their conqueſtes, if ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had ben in thoſe dayes. Concerning the ſeconde thing, that men cannot ſhew their ſtrenght, as they mighte in olde time, becauſe of the artillerie, I ſaye, that it is trew, that where men ſcattered doe ſhewe it, they ſtonde in more perrill, then in thoſe dayes, when they had to ſcale a toune, or to make lyke aſſaltes, where men not thronged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but ſeuerally the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other did apeare. It is alſo trewe that the Capitaines, and heddes of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12127:160"/> armies, ſtande more ſubiecte to the perrill of deathe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe times, becauſe they may be reached with artillerie in all places, nor it helpeth not them to bee in the rerewardes, garded with moſte ſtrong men. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is ſeen, that the one and the other of theſe twoo perrills, doo ſeldom times extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hurtes, for that the tounes well appoincted and furneſhed with munition ar not ſcaled, nor they gow not with weake aſſaltes to aſſalte them: but mynding to winne them, the matter is broughte to a ſege, as in old time they did. And in thoſe, which neuertheleſſe ar won by aſſalte, the perrills ar not muche greater then they wer in thoſe dayes: for that alſo in thoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, they which defended a toune, lacked not thinges to throw and ſhute, the which (though they wer not ſo furius) they did concerning the killing of men the lyke effecte. Concerning the death of Capitaines and conducters, there hathe ben in .xxiiij. yeres that the warre was of late dayes in Italy, leſſe examples, then there was in x. yeres with the antiquetie: for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte Count Lodouike of Mirandola, who died at Fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rare, when the Venetians, a few yeres agon, aſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame ſtate, and the Duke of Nemors, which died a Cirignuola, there hathe not hapned of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie enie to be ſlaine: for as muche as Mounſier de Fois at Rauenna, died of yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not of fier. So that if men ſhewe not particularly their ſtrenghthes, it groweth not of the artillerie, but of the naughthie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and of the weaknes of the armies, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lacking ſtrenghth, cannot ſhow it in parte. Concerning the thirde thing ſayde of them, that men cannot cum to hande ſtrokes, &amp; that the warre ſhalbe broughte to ſtande alltogether vpon artillerie, I ſaye, that this opinion is alltogether falſe: and ſo allwayes ſhalbe taken of thoſe, who according to the aunciente vertue will occupie their armies: for that he that will
<pb facs="tcp:12127:161"/> make a good armie, it behoueth him with exerſiſes, eyther fained, or trew, to accuſtome his men to giue the charge on the enemy, and to cum to the ſwerdes poincte with him, and to the graſpine by the boſom: &amp; he ought to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him ſelf more vpon the footemen, then vpon the horſemen. And when he ſhall grounde him ſelfe vpon the footemen, and vpon the forſayde maners, the artillerie becummeth alltogether vnprof<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fittable. For that with more facelety, the footemen in aproching nere the enemie, may auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhot of the artillerie, then they wer abell in olde time to auoide the violence of Elifantes, of cartes full of hookes, and of other ſtraunge incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, which the Romaine foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temen incountered withall, againſt which, allwayes they founde the remedie, and ſo muche more eaſelie they ſhould haue found againſte this, the ſhorter that the time is, in the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> artillerie maye hurte thee, then the ſame was, in the which the elifantes &amp; the cartes wer abell to hurte: for as muche as they in the middeſt of the faighte diſordered men, theſe only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fayghte doe troble men: the which impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente the footemen eaſely auoide, eyther with go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing keuered by the nature of the ſituation, or with falling doune vpon the grounde, when they ſhoote: the which alſo by experience hathe ben ſeen not to bee nedefull, in eſpetially to be defended from greate ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunce, the which cannot in ſuche wyſe bee leuelled, becauſe yf they gowe highe, they touche thee not, and if they gow lowe, they will not cum nere thee. Then the armies being come to handeſtrokes, this is more clear, then the lighte, that neyther the greate, nor the littell can after hurte thee: for that if the ſame, which hathe the artillerie, be before, it becumeth thy priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if it behynde, it hurteth the friende before thee. Againe on the backe it cannot hurte thee after ſuche ſorte, that thou arte not abell to gow to winne it, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12127:161"/> it cumeth to followe the ſayde effecte. Nor this nede not muche diſputation: for that there hathe ben ſeen the example of the Suizers, who at nauara in the yere of our lorde 1513. withoute artillerie, and withoute horſe, wente to incounter the Frenche armie furneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with artillerie within their fortreſſe, and they ouerthrew them withoute hauing enie impedimente thereby: and the reaſon is (beſids the thinges tolde afore) that the artillerie mynding to haue it worke hathe nede to be garded eyther of a wall, or of dyches, or of bankes. And when it lacketh on of theſe gardes, it is taken, or becumeth vnprofitabell, as it hapneth when it is defended with men, for where they chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe to be in a battayle, and in the faighte on the lande, they cannot bee occupied by flanke, but in the ſame maner, that the antiquetie occupied the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to ſhoote, which they placed oute of the ſquadrons, for that they ſhulde faight oute of the orders, &amp; allwayes when eyther of horſemen, or of other they wer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon, their refuge was behinde the legions: he that otherwyſe maketh accompte of them, hathe no ſkill, &amp; truſteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thing, which eaſely may deceyue him. And though the Turke by meanſe of artillerie, againſte the Sophi &amp; the Soldan, hathe had victory, it hath not happened through other mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the feare that the horſemen wer put in by the ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge rumor therof. Therfore to make an ende of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coorſe, I conclude, that the artillerie is proffittable in an armie, when the aunciente vertue is mingled therewith, but withoute the ſame, againſt a puiſante armie, it is moſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proffittabell.</p>
